# Future Plans
"This project is not fully finished yet, and there are a few functionalities that I would like to add in the future. Firstly, I plan to implement the ability for users to signup and sign in in the webpage using JavaScript. This will involve creating an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily signup and sign in in to the web page.

Another feature that I would like to add is the ability to sign out users from the platform. This could be done by making a nice sign out button in to the web page.

Finally, I plan to incorporate some fantastic security features into the platform. This will involve implementing advanced encryption protocols, as well as adding additional layers of authentication to ensure that only authorized users can sign in to the web page. Overall, I am excited to continue developing this project and I am looking forward to bringing these new functionalities to life."
